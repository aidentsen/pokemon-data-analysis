# Documentation

Purpose: to provide documentation of the data collection here, as well as observations from generation_datasets.py, which was used for the collation of data here

# Observations from generation_datasets.py
- Noticeably slower than the v0.2 iteration of dataset creation, which makes sense as additional validation is being used for every single value to retrieve
- It seems that on my system at least, it's faster to just run each generation individually compared to with other generations (comparing running gens 2 and 6 concurrently to just 3)

# Notes on the data here
- This is the raw data: it has not been processed or checked
- Species of note to check: Corsola (might be listed as unevolved form due to existence of Cursola)
- For processed, collated data, see the eventual `processed_data` folder
- Any processing and error logs are also provided here
